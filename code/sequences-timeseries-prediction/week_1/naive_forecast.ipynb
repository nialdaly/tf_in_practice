    "`Multivariate` timeseries are those where multiple values exist at each timestep.\n",

    "`Trend` - when a timeseries moves in a specific direction.\n",

    "`Seasonality` - when patterns in a timeseries tend to repeat at predictable intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Autocorrelation` - timeseries where no trend or seasonality exists. The timeseries correlates with a delayed copy of itself. This delayed copy is known as a `lag`.\n",
